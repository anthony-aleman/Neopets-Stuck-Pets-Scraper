# Neopets-Stuck-Pets-Scraper

Neopets is a website where users can own virtual pets they can care for and customize. Prestige is the name of the game, having an expensive looking pet with a cool name is a must for users wanting to flaunt their profile to other users of Neopets. Use this scraper and find the "stuck" pets you want and upgrade your profile. 

To filter the resulting CSV file returned from the scraper I created a CSV parser in C that would return 'well named' pets that avoid names with numbers, underscores and other symbols
